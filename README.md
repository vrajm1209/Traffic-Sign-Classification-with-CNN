# Classify-Traffic-Signs-with-CNN-Deep-Learning

Such a model can be of great use in the present increasing trend of self-driving cars. A model that is capable to classify traffic road signs to a near 100% would be a ground-breaking discovery for the future of self-driving cars. In this notebook, I try to undertake this classification task.

I perform Deep Learning by building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
Load image data
Perform image pre-processing. In this problem it involves coverting each image into a grey-scale and then normalizing it.
Built a Convolutional Neural Network Model that is capable to classify the test images correctly, with the help of a training and validation set.
To do the classifcation I built a Convulational Neural Network (CNN) is per the LeNet Network Architecture.
Evaluate the classifcation results
